# About Me
Welcome to my page! I am starting my first year of college here at Wake Tech as a computer science major. I have lived and went to school in Durham all my life up until I graduated high school two years ago. Since I started working in Morrisville this past year, I discovered Wake Technical Community College and became interested in the programs they had to offer! I plan to study at Wake Tech for two years before transferring to a university. 

## My Interests
Ever since I was a little kid I loved to draw and play video games with my siblings. I still love to draw and watch Youtubers play a variety of video games. I am really interested in the process behind decision based games. I often watch the behind the scenes of games or movies like _Avatar_, _Resident Evil_, _Detroit Become Human_, and _Until Dawn_. My dream is to be on a team of talented people who make games and movies like these and create meaningful experiences in the game industry.
